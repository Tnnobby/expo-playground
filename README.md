# expo-playground
This is just a project to develop React Native components, will likely grow a lot over time.

# Contents
- Reorderable-List
  - This is a component I am developing for another project I am working on, I'm aware there are other libraries out there that can accomplish the same thing but I wanted to try and recreate it myself :)
- Swipe-to-edit
  - This is another component for the same project, allows the user to swipe to display options such as delete or edit.
